git commit -am
// this adds (ALL) files assuming your are the root level of dir and stages it for the commit
// it is important to note where you are in the directory. safest to be at the root level of the directory
hello this is a lesson in progress

i want to know how to un-stage something

git log --oneline
// see all commits as a single line

foo bar baz
// widely established placeholder names

git fetch
// does not overwrite

git pull
// will overwrite

git stash, git stash apply
// stashes away changes and lets you assess the changes from a pull
// apply - applies the changes
